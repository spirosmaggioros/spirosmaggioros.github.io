  I am Spiros Maggioros, currently a Research Software Engineer at Penn Medicine - University of Pennsylvania, working
  on the NiChart Project(neuroimagingchart.com). I also study Electrical and Computer Engineering at National Technical
  University of Athens. My work focuses on Deep Learning(mostly Computer Vision and network architecture), MLOps,
  and making C++ implementations until they create a good package manager.
  My favorite language is C++, don't ask me why.
